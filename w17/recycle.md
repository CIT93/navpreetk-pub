# Identify the amount of waste that you recycle

I think checkboxes would work best. Checkboxes allow you to take multiple user inputs which is what's needed in this case. I would also add a select input to select whether they recycle in the first place and disable the checkboxes if they do not recycle. Or I could try to make all the options as checkboxes and disable all checkboxes if one doesn't recycle. I would need to similarly set up an event listener regardless to disable checkboxes if one doesnâ€™t recycle.
