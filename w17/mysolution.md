### water consumption 

I would maybe split the input for the dishwasher and washing machine. I would ask the user for each appliance their usage and also include the option to select if they don’t have the appliances for each. If they don’t have either machine, then 0 points would be given. Similar to how we are asking for other inputs, I would give the user options to select.
